# Full-Stack Application Deployment Guide

- This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a full-stack application on AWS cloud, including configuring an NGINX server. This deployment allows you to host your application on a single server. 
- The application is a full-stack web application that offers user authentication and interaction. Users can register, log in, and access personalized features. It provides a secure and user-friendly platform for managing and interacting with data, all while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. The frontend, built with React, offers an intuitive user interface, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express, manages data processing and communication with the RDS MySQL database. The NGINX enhances performance and security. This application serves as a foundation for developing dynamic and data-driven web services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have the following:

- An AWS account with RDS MySQL, EC2(local machine can be used instead), and security groups set up.
- The [Full-Stack MERN Deployment Repository](https://github.com/shamim-iq/fullstack-mern-nginx-deployment).
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and the command line.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create an RDS MySQL Database and an EC2 Instance**:

   - Create an RDS MySQL database in your AWS account.
   - Launch an EC2 instance according to your preferences.

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:

   - Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/shamim-iq/fullstack-mern-nginx-deployment.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   - Change your current directory to the project directory:
     ```
     cd fullstack-mern-nginx-deployment
     ```

4. **Install Required Software**:

   - Install Node.js, npm, and MySQL on your EC2 instance.

5. **Edit the Server Configuration**:

   - Navigate to the `/server` directory and edit the `server.js` file to configure the MySQL database connection with your RDS instance.
     ```
     const db = mysql.createConnection({
     host: '<RDS_Endpoint>',
     port: '3306',
     user: '<username>',
     password: '<password>',
     database: '<db_name>',
     });
     ```

6. **Connect to RDS MySQL**:

   - Connect to your RDS MySQL database using the MySQL command-line client:
     ```
     mysql -h <RDS_Endpoint> -P 3306 -u <user_name> -p
     ```

7. **Select Database**:

   - Select the database you want to use:
     ```
     use <db_name>
     ```

8. **Create a Table**:

   - Create a table named "users" with two columns: "username" and "password".
     ```
     CREATE TABLE users (username VARCHAR(20), password VARCHAR(20));
     ```

9. **Edit Client Configuration**:

   - Navigate to the `/client` directory and add a "proxy" line in the `package.json` file to specify the backend server's URL:
     ```
     "proxy": "http://<instance_public_ip>:3001/"
     ```

10. **Start the Frontend**:
    - Navigate to the `/client` directory and run the following command to start the frontend application on port 3000:
      ```
      npm start &
      ```

11. **Start the Backend**:

    - Navigate to the `/server` directory and run the following command to start the backend server on port 3001:
      ```
      npm run dev &
      ```

12. **Check Both Ends**:

    - Open a web browser and access `<instance_ip>:3000` to verify that both the frontend and backend are working correctly.

13. **Install NGINX and Configure Firewall**:

    - Install NGINX on your EC2 instance and ensure that the necessary ports are allowed on the firewall.

14. **Edit NGINX Configuration**:

    - Use a text editor to edit the NGINX configuration file:
      ```
      sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      ```

15. **NGINX Configuration**:

    - Edit the file with the following configuration, replacing `<instance_public_ip>` with your instance's public IP address:
      ```
      server_name <instance_public_ip>;

      location / {
      proxy_pass http://<instance_public_ip>:3000;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      }
      ```
16. **Remove Default NGINX Configuration**:

    - Remove the default NGINX configuration file from the enabled sites:
      ```
      sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
      ```

17. **Enable Custom Configuration**:

    - Create a symbolic link to enable your custom NGINX configuration:
      ```
      sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
      ```

18. **Test NGINX Configuration**:

    - Verify that your NGINX configuration is correct without syntax errors:
      ```
      sudo nginx -t
      ```

19. **Reload NGINX**:

    - Reload NGINX to apply the new configuration:
      ```
      sudo service nginx reload
      ```

20. **Access the Application**:

    - Access the application on your EC2 instance's public IP address without specifying a port.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will enable you to deploy a full-stack application with NGINX on AWS. Remember to replace placeholders like `<instance_public_ip>`, `<RDS_Endpoint>`, `<user_name>`, and `<db_name>` with your specific configuration details. You can now access your application via your EC2 instance's public IP address.
